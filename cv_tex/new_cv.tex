\section{Professional Summary}
Seasoned researcher interested in FPGAs and efficient architectures for deep
learning applications. My recent projects involve developing high-speed,
low-latency machine learning solutions for RF communication systems on the
Xilinx RFSoC board, building token dataflow overlay architectures for
accelerating highly sparse and irregular workloads, and more. I am a strong
programmer and lifelong learner who has a keen interest in doing cutting-edge
research and development.
