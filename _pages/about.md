Welcome to my personal page. Here, I try to keep an up-to-date account of
projects I have worked on, and also write blog posts on the side. I have worked
intimately with FPGAs in the past, and I believe they will play an increasingly
important role in the post-Moore future of computing. Lately, apart from
hardware engineering, my interests have also revolved around the fast-evolving
space of deep learning.
