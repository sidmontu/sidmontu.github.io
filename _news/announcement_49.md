I have successfully completed a Coursera MOOC on [Machine Learning Engineering
for Production
(MLOps)](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/certificate/8YL48TSUT99Y).
This was a 4-module specialization that gave a tour and practical hands-on
experience of machine learning tools & techniques to bring modern ML solutions
into production.
